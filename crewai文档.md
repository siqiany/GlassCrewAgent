# Crafting Effective Agents

> Learn best practices for designing powerful, specialized AI agents that collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.

## The Art and Science of Agent Design

At the heart of CrewAI lies the agent - a specialized AI entity designed to perform specific roles within a collaborative framework. While creating basic agents is simple, crafting truly effective agents that produce exceptional results requires understanding key design principles and best practices.

This guide will help you master the art of agent design, enabling you to create specialized AI personas that collaborate effectively, think critically, and produce high-quality outputs tailored to your specific needs.

### Why Agent Design Matters

The way you define your agents significantly impacts:

1. **Output quality**: Well-designed agents produce more relevant, high-quality results
2. **Collaboration effectiveness**: Agents with complementary skills work together more efficiently
3. **Task performance**: Agents with clear roles and goals execute tasks more effectively
4. **System scalability**: Thoughtfully designed agents can be reused across multiple crews and contexts

Let's explore best practices for creating agents that excel in these dimensions.

## The 80/20 Rule: Focus on Tasks Over Agents

When building effective AI systems, remember this crucial principle: **80% of your effort should go into designing tasks, and only 20% into defining agents**.

Why? Because even the most perfectly defined agent will fail with poorly designed tasks, but well-designed tasks can elevate even a simple agent. This means:

* Spend most of your time writing clear task instructions
* Define detailed inputs and expected outputs
* Add examples and context to guide execution
* Dedicate the remaining time to agent role, goal, and backstory

This doesn't mean agent design isn't important - it absolutely is. But task design is where most execution failures occur, so prioritize accordingly.

## Core Principles of Effective Agent Design

### 1. The Role-Goal-Backstory Framework

The most powerful agents in CrewAI are built on a strong foundation of three key elements:

#### Role: The Agent's Specialized Function

The role defines what the agent does and their area of expertise. When crafting roles:

* **Be specific and specialized**: Instead of "Writer," use "Technical Documentation Specialist" or "Creative Storyteller"
* **Align with real-world professions**: Base roles on recognizable professional archetypes
* **Include domain expertise**: Specify the agent's field of knowledge (e.g., "Financial Analyst specializing in market trends")

**Examples of effective roles:**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Senior UX Researcher specializing in user interview analysis"
role: "Full-Stack Software Architect with expertise in distributed systems"
role: "Corporate Communications Director specializing in crisis management"
```

#### Goal: The Agent's Purpose and Motivation

The goal directs the agent's efforts and shapes their decision-making process. Effective goals should:

* **Be clear and outcome-focused**: Define what the agent is trying to achieve
* **Emphasize quality standards**: Include expectations about the quality of work
* **Incorporate success criteria**: Help the agent understand what "good" looks like

**Examples of effective goals:**

```yaml  theme={null}
goal: "Uncover actionable user insights by analyzing interview data and identifying recurring patterns, unmet needs, and improvement opportunities"
goal: "Design robust, scalable system architectures that balance performance, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness"
goal: "Craft clear, empathetic crisis communications that address stakeholder concerns while protecting organizational reputation"
```

#### Backstory: The Agent's Experience and Perspective

The backstory gives depth to the agent, influencing how they approach problems and interact with others. Good backstories:

* **Establish expertise and experience**: Explain how the agent gained their skills
* **Define working style and values**: Describe how the agent approaches their work
* **Create a cohesive persona**: Ensure all elements of the backstory align with the role and goal

**Examples of effective backstories:**

```yaml  theme={null}
backstory: "You have spent 15 years conducting and analyzing user research for top tech companies. You have a talent for reading between the lines and identifying patterns that others miss. You believe that good UX is invisible and that the best insights come from listening to what users don't say as much as what they do say."

backstory: "With 20+ years of experience building distributed systems at scale, you've developed a pragmatic approach to software architecture. You've seen both successful and failed systems and have learned valuable lessons from each. You balance theoretical best practices with practical constraints and always consider the maintenance and operational aspects of your designs."

backstory: "As a seasoned communications professional who has guided multiple organizations through high-profile crises, you understand the importance of transparency, speed, and empathy in crisis response. You have a methodical approach to crafting messages that address concerns while maintaining organizational credibility."
```

### 2. Specialists Over Generalists

Agents perform significantly better when given specialized roles rather than general ones. A highly focused agent delivers more precise, relevant outputs:

**Generic (Less Effective):**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Writer"
```

**Specialized (More Effective):**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Technical Blog Writer specializing in explaining complex AI concepts to non-technical audiences"
```

**Specialist Benefits:**

* Clearer understanding of expected output
* More consistent performance
* Better alignment with specific tasks
* Improved ability to make domain-specific judgments

### 3. Balancing Specialization and Versatility

Effective agents strike the right balance between specialization (doing one thing extremely well) and versatility (being adaptable to various situations):

* **Specialize in role, versatile in application**: Create agents with specialized skills that can be applied across multiple contexts
* **Avoid overly narrow definitions**: Ensure agents can handle variations within their domain of expertise
* **Consider the collaborative context**: Design agents whose specializations complement the other agents they'll work with

### 4. Setting Appropriate Expertise Levels

The expertise level you assign to your agent shapes how they approach tasks:

* **Novice agents**: Good for straightforward tasks, brainstorming, or initial drafts
* **Intermediate agents**: Suitable for most standard tasks with reliable execution
* **Expert agents**: Best for complex, specialized tasks requiring depth and nuance
* **World-class agents**: Reserved for critical tasks where exceptional quality is needed

Choose the appropriate expertise level based on task complexity and quality requirements. For most collaborative crews, a mix of expertise levels often works best, with higher expertise assigned to core specialized functions.

## Practical Examples: Before and After

Let's look at some examples of agent definitions before and after applying these best practices:

### Example 1: Content Creation Agent

**Before:**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Writer"
goal: "Write good content"
backstory: "You are a writer who creates content for websites."
```

**After:**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "B2B Technology Content Strategist"
goal: "Create compelling, technically accurate content that explains complex topics in accessible language while driving reader engagement and supporting business objectives"
backstory: "You have spent a decade creating content for leading technology companies, specializing in translating technical concepts for business audiences. You excel at research, interviewing subject matter experts, and structuring information for maximum clarity and impact. You believe that the best B2B content educates first and sells second, building trust through genuine expertise rather than marketing hype."
```

### Example 2: Research Agent

**Before:**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Researcher"
goal: "Find information"
backstory: "You are good at finding information online."
```

**After:**

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Academic Research Specialist in Emerging Technologies"
goal: "Discover and synthesize cutting-edge research, identifying key trends, methodologies, and findings while evaluating the quality and reliability of sources"
backstory: "With a background in both computer science and library science, you've mastered the art of digital research. You've worked with research teams at prestigious universities and know how to navigate academic databases, evaluate research quality, and synthesize findings across disciplines. You're methodical in your approach, always cross-referencing information and tracing claims to primary sources before drawing conclusions."
```

## Crafting Effective Tasks for Your Agents

While agent design is important, task design is critical for successful execution. Here are best practices for designing tasks that set your agents up for success:

### The Anatomy of an Effective Task

A well-designed task has two key components that serve different purposes:

#### Task Description: The Process

The description should focus on what to do and how to do it, including:

* Detailed instructions for execution
* Context and background information
* Scope and constraints
* Process steps to follow

#### Expected Output: The Deliverable

The expected output should define what the final result should look like:

* Format specifications (markdown, JSON, etc.)
* Structure requirements
* Quality criteria
* Examples of good outputs (when possible)

### Task Design Best Practices

#### 1. Single Purpose, Single Output

Tasks perform best when focused on one clear objective:

**Bad Example (Too Broad):**

```yaml  theme={null}
task_description: "Research market trends, analyze the data, and create a visualization."
```

**Good Example (Focused):**

```yaml  theme={null}
# Task 1
research_task:
  description: "Research the top 5 market trends in the AI industry for 2024."
  expected_output: "A markdown list of the 5 trends with supporting evidence."

# Task 2
analysis_task:
  description: "Analyze the identified trends to determine potential business impacts."
  expected_output: "A structured analysis with impact ratings (High/Medium/Low)."

# Task 3
visualization_task:
  description: "Create a visual representation of the analyzed trends."
  expected_output: "A description of a chart showing trends and their impact ratings."
```

#### 2. Be Explicit About Inputs and Outputs

Always clearly specify what inputs the task will use and what the output should look like:

**Example:**

```yaml  theme={null}
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the customer feedback data from the CSV file.
    Focus on identifying recurring themes related to product usability.
    Consider sentiment and frequency when determining importance.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown report with the following sections:
    1. Executive summary (3-5 bullet points)
    2. Top 3 usability issues with supporting data
    3. Recommendations for improvement
```

#### 3. Include Purpose and Context

Explain why the task matters and how it fits into the larger workflow:

**Example:**

```yaml  theme={null}
competitor_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze our three main competitors' pricing strategies.
    This analysis will inform our upcoming pricing model revision.
    Focus on identifying patterns in how they price premium features
    and how they structure their tiered offerings.
```

#### 4. Use Structured Output Tools

For machine-readable outputs, specify the format clearly:

**Example:**

```yaml  theme={null}
data_extraction_task:
  description: "Extract key metrics from the quarterly report."
  expected_output: "JSON object with the following keys: revenue, growth_rate, customer_acquisition_cost, and retention_rate."
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Based on lessons learned from real-world implementations, here are the most common pitfalls in agent and task design:

### 1. Unclear Task Instructions

**Problem:** Tasks lack sufficient detail, making it difficult for agents to execute effectively.

**Example of Poor Design:**

```yaml  theme={null}
research_task:
  description: "Research AI trends."
  expected_output: "A report on AI trends."
```

**Improved Version:**

```yaml  theme={null}
research_task:
  description: >
    Research the top emerging AI trends for 2024 with a focus on:
    1. Enterprise adoption patterns
    2. Technical breakthroughs in the past 6 months
    3. Regulatory developments affecting implementation

    For each trend, identify key companies, technologies, and potential business impacts.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive markdown report with:
    - Executive summary (5 bullet points)
    - 5-7 major trends with supporting evidence
    - For each trend: definition, examples, and business implications
    - References to authoritative sources
```

### 2. "God Tasks" That Try to Do Too Much

**Problem:** Tasks that combine multiple complex operations into one instruction set.

**Example of Poor Design:**

```yaml  theme={null}
comprehensive_task:
  description: "Research market trends, analyze competitor strategies, create a marketing plan, and design a launch timeline."
```

**Improved Version:**
Break this into sequential, focused tasks:

```yaml  theme={null}
# Task 1: Research
market_research_task:
  description: "Research current market trends in the SaaS project management space."
  expected_output: "A markdown summary of key market trends."

# Task 2: Competitive Analysis
competitor_analysis_task:
  description: "Analyze strategies of the top 3 competitors based on the market research."
  expected_output: "A comparison table of competitor strategies."
  context: [market_research_task]

# Continue with additional focused tasks...
```

### 3. Misaligned Description and Expected Output

**Problem:** The task description asks for one thing while the expected output specifies something different.

**Example of Poor Design:**

```yaml  theme={null}
analysis_task:
  description: "Analyze customer feedback to find areas of improvement."
  expected_output: "A marketing plan for the next quarter."
```

**Improved Version:**

```yaml  theme={null}
analysis_task:
  description: "Analyze customer feedback to identify the top 3 areas for product improvement."
  expected_output: "A report listing the 3 priority improvement areas with supporting customer quotes and data points."
```

### 4. Not Understanding the Process Yourself

**Problem:** Asking agents to execute tasks that you yourself don't fully understand.

**Solution:**

1. Try to perform the task manually first
2. Document your process, decision points, and information sources
3. Use this documentation as the basis for your task description

### 5. Premature Use of Hierarchical Structures

**Problem:** Creating unnecessarily complex agent hierarchies where sequential processes would work better.

**Solution:** Start with sequential processes and only move to hierarchical models when the workflow complexity truly requires it.

### 6. Vague or Generic Agent Definitions

**Problem:** Generic agent definitions lead to generic outputs.

**Example of Poor Design:**

```yaml  theme={null}
agent:
  role: "Business Analyst"
  goal: "Analyze business data"
  backstory: "You are good at business analysis."
```

**Improved Version:**

```yaml  theme={null}
agent:
  role: "SaaS Metrics Specialist focusing on growth-stage startups"
  goal: "Identify actionable insights from business data that can directly impact customer retention and revenue growth"
  backstory: "With 10+ years analyzing SaaS business models, you've developed a keen eye for the metrics that truly matter for sustainable growth. You've helped numerous companies identify the leverage points that turned around their business trajectory. You believe in connecting data to specific, actionable recommendations rather than general observations."
```

## Advanced Agent Design Strategies

### Designing for Collaboration

When creating agents that will work together in a crew, consider:

* **Complementary skills**: Design agents with distinct but complementary abilities
* **Handoff points**: Define clear interfaces for how work passes between agents
* **Constructive tension**: Sometimes, creating agents with slightly different perspectives can lead to better outcomes through productive dialogue

For example, a content creation crew might include:

```yaml  theme={null}
# Research Agent
role: "Research Specialist for technical topics"
goal: "Gather comprehensive, accurate information from authoritative sources"
backstory: "You are a meticulous researcher with a background in library science..."

# Writer Agent
role: "Technical Content Writer"
goal: "Transform research into engaging, clear content that educates and informs"
backstory: "You are an experienced writer who excels at explaining complex concepts..."

# Editor Agent
role: "Content Quality Editor"
goal: "Ensure content is accurate, well-structured, and polished while maintaining consistency"
backstory: "With years of experience in publishing, you have a keen eye for detail..."
```

### Creating Specialized Tool Users

Some agents can be designed specifically to leverage certain tools effectively:

```yaml  theme={null}
role: "Data Analysis Specialist"
goal: "Derive meaningful insights from complex datasets through statistical analysis"
backstory: "With a background in data science, you excel at working with structured and unstructured data..."
tools: [PythonREPLTool, DataVisualizationTool, CSVAnalysisTool]
```

### Tailoring Agents to LLM Capabilities

Different LLMs have different strengths. Design your agents with these capabilities in mind:

```yaml  theme={null}
# For complex reasoning tasks
analyst:
  role: "Data Insights Analyst"
  goal: "..."
  backstory: "..."
  llm: openai/gpt-4o

# For creative content
writer:
  role: "Creative Content Writer"
  goal: "..."
  backstory: "..."
  llm: anthropic/claude-3-opus
```

## Testing and Iterating on Agent Design

Agent design is often an iterative process. Here's a practical approach:

1. **Start with a prototype**: Create an initial agent definition
2. **Test with sample tasks**: Evaluate performance on representative tasks
3. **Analyze outputs**: Identify strengths and weaknesses
4. **Refine the definition**: Adjust role, goal, and backstory based on observations
5. **Test in collaboration**: Evaluate how the agent performs in a crew setting

## Conclusion

Crafting effective agents is both an art and a science. By carefully defining roles, goals, and backstories that align with your specific needs, and combining them with well-designed tasks, you can create specialized AI collaborators that produce exceptional results.

Remember that agent and task design is an iterative process. Start with these best practices, observe your agents in action, and refine your approach based on what you learn. And always keep in mind the 80/20 rule - focus most of your effort on creating clear, focused tasks to get the best results from your agents.

# Build Your First Crew

> Step-by-step tutorial to create a collaborative AI team that works together to solve complex problems.

## Unleashing the Power of Collaborative AI

Imagine having a team of specialized AI agents working together seamlessly to solve complex problems, each contributing their unique skills to achieve a common goal. This is the power of CrewAI - a framework that enables you to create collaborative AI systems that can accomplish tasks far beyond what a single AI could achieve alone.

In this guide, we'll walk through creating a research crew that will help us research and analyze a topic, then create a comprehensive report. This practical example demonstrates how AI agents can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks, but it's just the beginning of what's possible with CrewAI.

### What You'll Build and Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

1. **Created a specialized AI research team** with distinct roles and responsibilities
2. **Orchestrated collaboration** between multiple AI agents
3. **Automated a complex workflow** that involves gathering information, analysis, and report generation
4. **Built foundational skills** that you can apply to more ambitious projects

While we're building a simple research crew in this guide, the same patterns and techniques can be applied to create much more sophisticated teams for tasks like:

* Multi-stage content creation with specialized writers, editors, and fact-checkers
* Complex customer service systems with tiered support agents
* Autonomous business analysts that gather data, create visualizations, and generate insights
* Product development teams that ideate, design, and plan implementation

Let's get started building your first crew!

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. Installed CrewAI following the [installation guide](/en/installation)
2. Set up your LLM API key in your environment, following the [LLM setup
   guide](/en/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm)
3. Basic understanding of Python

## Step 1: Create a New CrewAI Project

First, let's create a new CrewAI project using the CLI. This command will set up a complete project structure with all the necessary files, allowing you to focus on defining your agents and their tasks rather than setting up boilerplate code.

```bash  theme={null}
crewai create crew research_crew
cd research_crew
```

This will generate a project with the basic structure needed for your crew. The CLI automatically creates:

* A project directory with the necessary files
* Configuration files for agents and tasks
* A basic crew implementation
* A main script to run the crew

</Frame>

## Step 2: Explore the Project Structure

Let's take a moment to understand the project structure created by the CLI. CrewAI follows best practices for Python projects, making it easy to maintain and extend your code as your crews become more complex.

```
research_crew/
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .env
└── src/
    └── research_crew/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── main.py
        ├── crew.py
        ├── tools/
        │   ├── custom_tool.py
        │   └── __init__.py
        └── config/
            ├── agents.yaml
            └── tasks.yaml
```

This structure follows best practices for Python projects and makes it easy to organize your code. The separation of configuration files (in YAML) from implementation code (in Python) makes it easy to modify your crew's behavior without changing the underlying code.

## Step 3: Configure Your Agents

Now comes the fun part - defining your AI agents! In CrewAI, agents are specialized entities with specific roles, goals, and backstories that shape their behavior. Think of them as characters in a play, each with their own personality and purpose.

For our research crew, we'll create two agents:

1. A **researcher** who excels at finding and organizing information
2. An **analyst** who can interpret research findings and create insightful reports

Let's modify the `agents.yaml` file to define these specialized agents. Be sure
to set `llm` to the provider you are using.

```yaml  theme={null}
# src/research_crew/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: >
    Senior Research Specialist for {topic}
  goal: >
    Find comprehensive and accurate information about {topic}
    with a focus on recent developments and key insights
  backstory: >
    You are an experienced research specialist with a talent for
    finding relevant information from various sources. You excel at
    organizing information in a clear and structured manner, making
    complex topics accessible to others.
  llm: provider/model-id  # e.g. openai/gpt-4o, google/gemini-2.0-flash, anthropic/claude...

analyst:
  role: >
    Data Analyst and Report Writer for {topic}
  goal: >
    Analyze research findings and create a comprehensive, well-structured
    report that presents insights in a clear and engaging way
  backstory: >
    You are a skilled analyst with a background in data interpretation
    and technical writing. You have a talent for identifying patterns
    and extracting meaningful insights from research data, then
    communicating those insights effectively through well-crafted reports.
  llm: provider/model-id  # e.g. openai/gpt-4o, google/gemini-2.0-flash, anthropic/claude...
```

Notice how each agent has a distinct role, goal, and backstory. These elements aren't just descriptive - they actively shape how the agent approaches its tasks. By crafting these carefully, you can create agents with specialized skills and perspectives that complement each other.

## Step 4: Define Your Tasks

With our agents defined, we now need to give them specific tasks to perform. Tasks in CrewAI represent the concrete work that agents will perform, with detailed instructions and expected outputs.

For our research crew, we'll define two main tasks:

1. A **research task** for gathering comprehensive information
2. An **analysis task** for creating an insightful report

Let's modify the `tasks.yaml` file:

```yaml  theme={null}
# src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct thorough research on {topic}. Focus on:
    1. Key concepts and definitions
    2. Historical development and recent trends
    3. Major challenges and opportunities
    4. Notable applications or case studies
    5. Future outlook and potential developments

    Make sure to organize your findings in a structured format with clear sections.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive research document with well-organized sections covering
    all the requested aspects of {topic}. Include specific facts, figures,
    and examples where relevant.
  agent: researcher

analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the research findings and create a comprehensive report on {topic}.
    Your report should:
    1. Begin with an executive summary
    2. Include all key information from the research
    3. Provide insightful analysis of trends and patterns
    4. Offer recommendations or future considerations
    5. Be formatted in a professional, easy-to-read style with clear headings
  expected_output: >
    A polished, professional report on {topic} that presents the research
    findings with added analysis and insights. The report should be well-structured
    with an executive summary, main sections, and conclusion.
  agent: analyst
  context:
    - research_task
  output_file: output/report.md
```

Note the `context` field in the analysis task - this is a powerful feature that allows the analyst to access the output of the research task. This creates a workflow where information flows naturally between agents, just as it would in a human team.

## Step 5: Configure Your Crew

Now it's time to bring everything together by configuring our crew. The crew is the container that orchestrates how agents work together to complete tasks.

Let's modify the `crew.py` file:

```python  theme={null}
# src/research_crew/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class ResearchCrew():
    """Research crew for comprehensive topic analysis and reporting"""

    agents: List[BaseAgent]
    tasks: List[Task]

    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
            verbose=True,
            tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

    @agent
    def analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['analyst'], # type: ignore[index]
            verbose=True
        )

    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['research_task'] # type: ignore[index]
        )

    @task
    def analysis_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['analysis_task'], # type: ignore[index]
            output_file='output/report.md'
        )

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the research crew"""
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

In this code, we're:

1. Creating the researcher agent and equipping it with the SerperDevTool to search the web
2. Creating the analyst agent
3. Setting up the research and analysis tasks
4. Configuring the crew to run tasks sequentially (the analyst will wait for the researcher to finish)

This is where the magic happens - with just a few lines of code, we've defined a collaborative AI system where specialized agents work together in a coordinated process.

## Step 6: Set Up Your Main Script

Now, let's set up the main script that will run our crew. This is where we provide the specific topic we want our crew to research.

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/research_crew/main.py
import os
from research_crew.crew import ResearchCrew

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('output', exist_ok=True)

def run():
    """
    Run the research crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare'
    }

    # Create and run the crew
    result = ResearchCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)

    # Print the result
    print("\n\n=== FINAL REPORT ===\n\n")
    print(result.raw)

    print("\n\nReport has been saved to output/report.md")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This script prepares the environment, specifies our research topic, and kicks off the crew's work. The power of CrewAI is evident in how simple this code is - all the complexity of managing multiple AI agents is handled by the framework.

## Step 7: Set Up Your Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your API keys:

```sh  theme={null}
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
# Add your provider's API key here too.
```

See the [LLM Setup guide](/en/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm) for details on configuring your provider of choice. You can get a Serper API key from [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/).

## Step 8: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using the CrewAI CLI:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai install
```

This command will:

1. Read the dependencies from your project configuration
2. Create a virtual environment if needed
3. Install all required packages

## Step 9: Run Your Crew

Now for the exciting moment - it's time to run your crew and see AI collaboration in action!

```bash  theme={null}
crewai run
```

When you run this command, you'll see your crew spring to life. The researcher will gather information about the specified topic, and the analyst will then create a comprehensive report based on that research. You'll see the agents' thought processes, actions, and outputs in real-time as they work together to complete their tasks.

## Step 10: Review the Output

Once the crew completes its work, you'll find the final report in the `output/report.md` file. The report will include:

1. An executive summary
2. Detailed information about the topic
3. Analysis and insights
4. Recommendations or future considerations

Take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished - you've created a system where multiple AI agents collaborated on a complex task, each contributing their specialized skills to produce a result that's greater than what any single agent could achieve alone.

## Exploring Other CLI Commands

CrewAI offers several other useful CLI commands for working with crews:

```bash  theme={null}
# View all available commands
crewai --help

# Run the crew
crewai run

# Test the crew
crewai test

# Reset crew memories
crewai reset-memories

# Replay from a specific task
crewai replay -t <task_id>
```

## The Art of the Possible: Beyond Your First Crew

What you've built in this guide is just the beginning. The skills and patterns you've learned can be applied to create increasingly sophisticated AI systems. Here are some ways you could extend this basic research crew:

### Expanding Your Crew

# Build Your First Flow

> Learn how to create structured, event-driven workflows with precise control over execution.

## Taking Control of AI Workflows with Flows

CrewAI Flows represent the next level in AI orchestration - combining the collaborative power of AI agent crews with the precision and flexibility of procedural programming. While crews excel at agent collaboration, flows give you fine-grained control over exactly how and when different components of your AI system interact.

In this guide, we'll walk through creating a powerful CrewAI Flow that generates a comprehensive learning guide on any topic. This tutorial will demonstrate how Flows provide structured, event-driven control over your AI workflows by combining regular code, direct LLM calls, and crew-based processing.

### What Makes Flows Powerful

Flows enable you to:

1. **Combine different AI interaction patterns** - Use crews for complex collaborative tasks, direct LLM calls for simpler operations, and regular code for procedural logic
2. **Build event-driven systems** - Define how components respond to specific events and data changes
3. **Maintain state across components** - Share and transform data between different parts of your application
4. **Integrate with external systems** - Seamlessly connect your AI workflow with databases, APIs, and user interfaces
5. **Create complex execution paths** - Design conditional branches, parallel processing, and dynamic workflows

### What You'll Build and Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

1. **Created a sophisticated content generation system** that combines user input, AI planning, and multi-agent content creation
2. **Orchestrated the flow of information** between different components of your system
3. **Implemented event-driven architecture** where each step responds to the completion of previous steps
4. **Built a foundation for more complex AI applications** that you can expand and customize

This guide creator flow demonstrates fundamental patterns that can be applied to create much more advanced applications, such as:

* Interactive AI assistants that combine multiple specialized subsystems
* Complex data processing pipelines with AI-enhanced transformations
* Autonomous agents that integrate with external services and APIs
* Multi-stage decision-making systems with human-in-the-loop processes

Let's dive in and build your first flow!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. Installed CrewAI following the [installation guide](/en/installation)
2. Set up your LLM API key in your environment, following the [LLM setup
   guide](/en/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm)
3. Basic understanding of Python

## Step 1: Create a New CrewAI Flow Project

First, let's create a new CrewAI Flow project using the CLI. This command sets up a scaffolded project with all the necessary directories and template files for your flow.

```bash  theme={null}
crewai create flow guide_creator_flow
cd guide_creator_flow
```

This will generate a project with the basic structure needed for your flow.

<Frame caption="CrewAI Framework Overview">
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/crewai/qVjgZHKAyEOgSSUS/images/flows.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=qVjgZHKAyEOgSSUS&q=85&s=82ea168de2f004553dcea21410cd7d8a" alt="CrewAI Framework Overview" width="669" height="464" data-path="images/flows.png" />
</Frame>

## Step 2: Understanding the Project Structure

The generated project has the following structure. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with it, as understanding this structure will help you create more complex flows in the future.

```
guide_creator_flow/
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .env
├── main.py
├── crews/
│   └── poem_crew/
│       ├── config/
│       │   ├── agents.yaml
│       │   └── tasks.yaml
│       └── poem_crew.py
└── tools/
    └── custom_tool.py
```

This structure provides a clear separation between different components of your flow:

* The main flow logic in the `main.py` file
* Specialized crews in the `crews` directory
* Custom tools in the `tools` directory

We'll modify this structure to create our guide creator flow, which will orchestrate the process of generating comprehensive learning guides.

## Step 3: Add a Content Writer Crew

Our flow will need a specialized crew to handle the content creation process. Let's use the CrewAI CLI to add a content writer crew:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai flow add-crew content-crew
```

This command automatically creates the necessary directories and template files for your crew. The content writer crew will be responsible for writing and reviewing sections of our guide, working within the overall flow orchestrated by our main application.

## Step 4: Configure the Content Writer Crew

Now, let's modify the generated files for the content writer crew. We'll set up two specialized agents - a writer and a reviewer - that will collaborate to create high-quality content for our guide.

1. First, update the agents configuration file to define our content creation team:

   Remember to set `llm` to the provider you are using.

```yaml  theme={null}
# src/guide_creator_flow/crews/content_crew/config/agents.yaml
content_writer:
  role: >
    Educational Content Writer
  goal: >
    Create engaging, informative content that thoroughly explains the assigned topic
    and provides valuable insights to the reader
  backstory: >
    You are a talented educational writer with expertise in creating clear, engaging
    content. You have a gift for explaining complex concepts in accessible language
    and organizing information in a way that helps readers build their understanding.
  llm: provider/model-id  # e.g. openai/gpt-4o, google/gemini-2.0-flash, anthropic/claude...

content_reviewer:
  role: >
    Educational Content Reviewer and Editor
  goal: >
    Ensure content is accurate, comprehensive, well-structured, and maintains
    consistency with previously written sections
  backstory: >
    You are a meticulous editor with years of experience reviewing educational
    content. You have an eye for detail, clarity, and coherence. You excel at
    improving content while maintaining the original author's voice and ensuring
    consistent quality across multiple sections.
  llm: provider/model-id  # e.g. openai/gpt-4o, google/gemini-2.0-flash, anthropic/claude...
```

These agent definitions establish the specialized roles and perspectives that will shape how our AI agents approach content creation. Notice how each agent has a distinct purpose and expertise.

2. Next, update the tasks configuration file to define the specific writing and reviewing tasks:

```yaml  theme={null}
# src/guide_creator_flow/crews/content_crew/config/tasks.yaml
write_section_task:
  description: >
    Write a comprehensive section on the topic: "{section_title}"

    Section description: {section_description}
    Target audience: {audience_level} level learners

    Your content should:
    1. Begin with a brief introduction to the section topic
    2. Explain all key concepts clearly with examples
    3. Include practical applications or exercises where appropriate
    4. End with a summary of key points
    5. Be approximately 500-800 words in length

    Format your content in Markdown with appropriate headings, lists, and emphasis.

    Previously written sections:
    {previous_sections}

    Make sure your content maintains consistency with previously written sections
    and builds upon concepts that have already been explained.
  expected_output: >
    A well-structured, comprehensive section in Markdown format that thoroughly
    explains the topic and is appropriate for the target audience.
  agent: content_writer

review_section_task:
  description: >
    Review and improve the following section on "{section_title}":

    {draft_content}

    Target audience: {audience_level} level learners

    Previously written sections:
    {previous_sections}

    Your review should:
    1. Fix any grammatical or spelling errors
    2. Improve clarity and readability
    3. Ensure content is comprehensive and accurate
    4. Verify consistency with previously written sections
    5. Enhance the structure and flow
    6. Add any missing key information

    Provide the improved version of the section in Markdown format.
  expected_output: >
    An improved, polished version of the section that maintains the original
    structure but enhances clarity, accuracy, and consistency.
  agent: content_reviewer
  context:
    - write_section_task
```

These task definitions provide detailed instructions to our agents, ensuring they produce content that meets our quality standards. Note how the `context` parameter in the review task creates a workflow where the reviewer has access to the writer's output.

3. Now, update the crew implementation file to define how our agents and tasks work together:

```python  theme={null}
# src/guide_creator_flow/crews/content_crew/content_crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class ContentCrew():
    """Content writing crew"""

    agents: List[BaseAgent]
    tasks: List[Task]

    @agent
    def content_writer(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['content_writer'], # type: ignore[index]
            verbose=True
        )

    @agent
    def content_reviewer(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['content_reviewer'], # type: ignore[index]
            verbose=True
        )

    @task
    def write_section_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['write_section_task'] # type: ignore[index]
        )

    @task
    def review_section_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['review_section_task'], # type: ignore[index]
            context=[self.write_section_task()]
        )

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the content writing crew"""
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

This crew definition establishes the relationship between our agents and tasks, setting up a sequential process where the content writer creates a draft and then the reviewer improves it. While this crew can function independently, in our flow it will be orchestrated as part of a larger system.

## Step 5: Create the Flow

Now comes the exciting part - creating the flow that will orchestrate the entire guide creation process. This is where we'll combine regular Python code, direct LLM calls, and our content creation crew into a cohesive system.

Our flow will:

1. Get user input for a topic and audience level
2. Make a direct LLM call to create a structured guide outline
3. Process each section sequentially using the content writer crew
4. Combine everything into a final comprehensive document

Let's create our flow in the `main.py` file:

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import json
import os
from typing import List, Dict
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crewai import LLM
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from guide_creator_flow.crews.content_crew.content_crew import ContentCrew

# Define our models for structured data
class Section(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="Title of the section")
    description: str = Field(description="Brief description of what the section should cover")

class GuideOutline(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="Title of the guide")
    introduction: str = Field(description="Introduction to the topic")
    target_audience: str = Field(description="Description of the target audience")
    sections: List[Section] = Field(description="List of sections in the guide")
    conclusion: str = Field(description="Conclusion or summary of the guide")

# Define our flow state
class GuideCreatorState(BaseModel):
    topic: str = ""
    audience_level: str = ""
    guide_outline: GuideOutline = None
    sections_content: Dict[str, str] = {}

class GuideCreatorFlow(Flow[GuideCreatorState]):
    """Flow for creating a comprehensive guide on any topic"""

    @start()
    def get_user_input(self):
        """Get input from the user about the guide topic and audience"""
        print("\n=== Create Your Comprehensive Guide ===\n")

        # Get user input
        self.state.topic = input("What topic would you like to create a guide for? ")

        # Get audience level with validation
        while True:
            audience = input("Who is your target audience? (beginner/intermediate/advanced) ").lower()
            if audience in ["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"]:
                self.state.audience_level = audience
                break
            print("Please enter 'beginner', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'")

        print(f"\nCreating a guide on {self.state.topic} for {self.state.audience_level} audience...\n")
        return self.state

    @listen(get_user_input)
    def create_guide_outline(self, state):
        """Create a structured outline for the guide using a direct LLM call"""
        print("Creating guide outline...")

        # Initialize the LLM
        llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", response_format=GuideOutline)

        # Create the messages for the outline
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"""
            Create a detailed outline for a comprehensive guide on "{state.topic}" for {state.audience_level} level learners.

            The outline should include:
            1. A compelling title for the guide
            2. An introduction to the topic
            3. 4-6 main sections that cover the most important aspects of the topic
            4. A conclusion or summary

            For each section, provide a clear title and a brief description of what it should cover.
            """}
        ]

        # Make the LLM call with JSON response format
        response = llm.call(messages=messages)

        # Parse the JSON response
        outline_dict = json.loads(response)
        self.state.guide_outline = GuideOutline(**outline_dict)

        # Ensure output directory exists before saving
        os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True)

        # Save the outline to a file
        with open("output/guide_outline.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump(outline_dict, f, indent=2)

        print(f"Guide outline created with {len(self.state.guide_outline.sections)} sections")
        return self.state.guide_outline

    @listen(create_guide_outline)
    def write_and_compile_guide(self, outline):

            else:
                previous_sections_text = "No previous sections written yet."

            # Run the content crew for this section
            result = ContentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={
                "section_title": section.title,
                "section_description": section.description,
                "audience_level": self.state.audience_level,
                "previous_sections": previous_sections_text,
                "draft_content": ""
            })

            # Store the content
            self.state.sections_content[section.title] = result.raw
            completed_sections.append(section.title)
            print(f"Section completed: {section.title}")

        # Compile the final guide

        # Save the guide
        with open("output/complete_guide.md", "w") as f:
            f.write(guide_content)

        print("\nComplete guide compiled and saved to output/complete_guide.md")
        return "Guide creation completed successfully"

def kickoff():
    """Run the guide creator flow"""
    GuideCreatorFlow().kickoff()
    print("\n=== Flow Complete ===")
    print("Your comprehensive guide is ready in the output directory.")
    print("Open output/complete_guide.md to view it.")

def plot():
    """Generate a visualization of the flow"""
    flow = GuideCreatorFlow()
    flow.plot("guide_creator_flow")
    print("Flow visualization saved to guide_creator_flow.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kickoff()
```

Let's analyze what's happening in this flow:

1. We define Pydantic models for structured data, ensuring type safety and clear data representation
2. We create a state class to maintain data across different steps of the flow
3. We implement three main flow steps:
   * Getting user input with the `@start()` decorator
   * Creating a guide outline with a direct LLM call
   * Processing sections with our content crew
4. We use the `@listen()` decorator to establish event-driven relationships between steps

This is the power of flows - combining different types of processing (user interaction, direct LLM calls, crew-based tasks) into a coherent, event-driven system.

## Step 6: Set Up Your Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your API keys. See the [LLM setup
guide](/en/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm) for details on configuring a provider.

```sh .env theme={null}
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# or
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
# or
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

## Step 7: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai install
```

## Step 8: Run Your Flow

Now it's time to see your flow in action! Run it using the CrewAI CLI:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai flow kickoff
```

When you run this command, you'll see your flow spring to life:

1. It will prompt you for a topic and audience level
2. It will create a structured outline for your guide
3. It will process each section, with the content writer and reviewer collaborating on each
4. Finally, it will compile everything into a comprehensive guide

This demonstrates the power of flows to orchestrate complex processes involving multiple components, both AI and non-AI.

## Step 9: Visualize Your Flow

One of the powerful features of flows is the ability to visualize their structure:

```bash  theme={null}
crewai flow plot
```

This will create an HTML file that shows the structure of your flow, including the relationships between different steps and the data that flows between them. This visualization can be invaluable for understanding and debugging complex flows.

## Step 10: Review the Output

Once the flow completes, you'll find two files in the `output` directory:

1. `guide_outline.json`: Contains the structured outline of the guide
2. `complete_guide.md`: The comprehensive guide with all sections

Take a moment to review these files and appreciate what you've built - a system that combines user input, direct AI interactions, and collaborative agent work to produce a complex, high-quality output.

## The Art of the Possible: Beyond Your First Flow

What you've learned in this guide provides a foundation for creating much more sophisticated AI systems. Here are some ways you could extend this basic flow:

### Enhancing User Interaction

You could create more interactive flows with:

* Web interfaces for input and output
* Real-time progress updates
* Interactive feedback and refinement loops
* Multi-stage user interactions

### Adding More Processing Steps

You could expand your flow with additional steps for:

* Research before outline creation
* Image generation for illustrations
* Code snippet generation for technical guides
* Final quality assurance and fact-checking

### Creating More Complex Flows

You could implement more sophisticated flow patterns:

* Conditional branching based on user preferences or content type
* Parallel processing of independent sections
* Iterative refinement loops with feedback
* Integration with external APIs and services

### Applying to Different Domains

The same patterns can be applied to create flows for:

* **Interactive storytelling**: Create personalized stories based on user input
* **Business intelligence**: Process data, generate insights, and create reports
* **Product development**: Facilitate ideation, design, and planning
* **Educational systems**: Create personalized learning experiences

## Key Features Demonstrated

This guide creator flow demonstrates several powerful features of CrewAI:

1. **User interaction**: The flow collects input directly from the user
2. **Direct LLM calls**: Uses the LLM class for efficient, single-purpose AI interactions
3. **Structured data with Pydantic**: Uses Pydantic models to ensure type safety
4. **Sequential processing with context**: Writes sections in order, providing previous sections for context
5. **Multi-agent crews**: Leverages specialized agents (writer and reviewer) for content creation
6. **State management**: Maintains state across different steps of the process
7. **Event-driven architecture**: Uses the `@listen` decorator to respond to events

## Understanding the Flow Structure

Let's break down the key components of flows to help you understand how to build your own:

### 1. Direct LLM Calls

Flows allow you to make direct calls to language models when you need simple, structured responses:

```python  theme={null}
llm = LLM(
    model="model-id-here",  # gpt-4o, gemini-2.0-flash, anthropic/claude...
    response_format=GuideOutline
)
response = llm.call(messages=messages)
```

This is more efficient than using a crew when you need a specific, structured output.

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

Flows use decorators to establish relationships between components:

```python  theme={null}
@start()
def get_user_input(self):
    # First step in the flow
    # ...

@listen(get_user_input)
def create_guide_outline(self, state):
    # This runs when get_user_input completes
    # ...
```

This creates a clear, declarative structure for your application.

### 3. State Management

Flows maintain state across steps, making it easy to share data:

```python  theme={null}
class GuideCreatorState(BaseModel):
    topic: str = ""
    audience_level: str = ""
    guide_outline: GuideOutline = None
    sections_content: Dict[str, str] = {}
```

This provides a type-safe way to track and transform data throughout your flow.

### 4. Crew Integration

Flows can seamlessly integrate with crews for complex collaborative tasks:

```python  theme={null}
result = ContentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={
    "section_title": section.title,
    # ...
})
```

This allows you to use the right tool for each part of your application - direct LLM calls for simple tasks and crews for complex collaboration.

## Next Steps

Now that you've built your first flow, you can:

1. Experiment with more complex flow structures and patterns
2. Try using `@router()` to create conditional branches in your flows
3. Explore the `and_` and `or_` functions for more complex parallel execution
4. Connect your flow to external APIs, databases, or user interfaces
5. Combine multiple specialized crews in a single flow

<Check>
  Congratulations! You've successfully built your first CrewAI Flow that combines regular code, direct LLM calls, and crew-based processing to create a comprehensive guide. These foundational skills enable you to create increasingly sophisticated AI applications that can tackle complex, multi-stage problems through a combination of procedural control and collaborative intelligence.

# Mastering Flow State Management

> A comprehensive guide to managing, persisting, and leveraging state in CrewAI Flows for building robust AI applications.

## Understanding the Power of State in Flows

State management is the backbone of any sophisticated AI workflow. In CrewAI Flows, the state system allows you to maintain context, share data between steps, and build complex application logic. Mastering state management is essential for creating reliable, maintainable, and powerful AI applications.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about managing state in CrewAI Flows, from basic concepts to advanced techniques, with practical code examples along the way.

### Why State Management Matters

Effective state management enables you to:

1. **Maintain context across execution steps** - Pass information seamlessly between different stages of your workflow
2. **Build complex conditional logic** - Make decisions based on accumulated data
3. **Create persistent applications** - Save and restore workflow progress
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement recovery patterns for more robust applications
5. **Scale your applications** - Support complex workflows with proper data organization
6. **Enable conversational applications** - Store and access conversation history for context-aware AI interactions

Let's explore how to leverage these capabilities effectively.

## State Management Fundamentals

### The Flow State Lifecycle

In CrewAI Flows, the state follows a predictable lifecycle:

1. **Initialization** - When a flow is created, its state is initialized (either as an empty dictionary or a Pydantic model instance)
2. **Modification** - Flow methods access and modify the state as they execute
3. **Transmission** - State is passed automatically between flow methods
4. **Persistence** (optional) - State can be saved to storage and later retrieved
5. **Completion** - The final state reflects the cumulative changes from all executed methods

Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for designing effective flows.

### Two Approaches to State Management

CrewAI offers two ways to manage state in your flows:

1. **Unstructured State** - Using dictionary-like objects for flexibility
2. **Structured State** - Using Pydantic models for type safety and validation

Let's examine each approach in detail.

## Unstructured State Management

Unstructured state uses a dictionary-like approach, offering flexibility and simplicity for straightforward applications.

### How It Works

With unstructured state:

* You access state via `self.state` which behaves like a dictionary
* You can freely add, modify, or remove keys at any point
* All state is automatically available to all flow methods

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example of unstructured state management:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UnstructuredStateFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def initialize_data(self):
        print("Initializing flow data")
        # Add key-value pairs to state
        self.state["user_name"] = "Alex"
        self.state["preferences"] = {
            "theme": "dark",
            "language": "English"
        }
        self.state["items"] = []

        # The flow state automatically gets a unique ID
        print(f"Flow ID: {self.state['id']}")

        return "Initialized"

    @listen(initialize_data)
    def process_data(self, previous_result):
        print(f"Previous step returned: {previous_result}")

        # Access and modify state
        user = self.state["user_name"]
        print(f"Processing data for {user}")

        # Add items to a list in state
        self.state["items"].append("item1")
        self.state["items"].append("item2")

        # Add a new key-value pair
        self.state["processed"] = True

        return "Processed"

    @listen(process_data)
    def generate_summary(self, previous_result):
        # Access multiple state values
        user = self.state["user_name"]
        theme = self.state["preferences"]["theme"]
        items = self.state["items"]
        processed = self.state.get("processed", False)

        summary = f"User {user} has {len(items)} items with {theme} theme. "
        summary += "Data is processed." if processed else "Data is not processed."

        return summary

# Run the flow
flow = UnstructuredStateFlow()
result = flow.kickoff()
print(f"Final result: {result}")
print(f"Final state: {flow.state}")
```

### When to Use Unstructured State

Unstructured state is ideal for:

* Quick prototyping and simple flows
* Dynamically evolving state needs
* Cases where the structure may not be known in advance
* Flows with simple state requirements

While flexible, unstructured state lacks type checking and schema validation, which can lead to errors in complex applications.

## Structured State Management

Structured state uses Pydantic models to define a schema for your flow's state, providing type safety, validation, and better developer experience.

### How It Works

With structured state:

* You define a Pydantic model that represents your state structure
* You pass this model type to your Flow class as a type parameter
* You access state via `self.state`, which behaves like a Pydantic model instance
* All fields are validated according to their defined types
* You get IDE autocompletion and type checking support

### Basic Example

Here's how to implement structured state management:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

# Define your state model
class UserPreferences(BaseModel):
    theme: str = "light"
    language: str = "English"

class AppState(BaseModel):
    user_name: str = ""
    preferences: UserPreferences = UserPreferences()
    items: List[str] = []
    processed: bool = False
    completion_percentage: float = 0.0

# Create a flow with typed state
class StructuredStateFlow(Flow[AppState]):
    @start()
    def initialize_data(self):
        print("Initializing flow data")
        # Set state values (type-checked)
        self.state.user_name = "Taylor"
        self.state.preferences.theme = "dark"

        # The ID field is automatically available
        print(f"Flow ID: {self.state.id}")

        return "Initialized"

    @listen(initialize_data)
    def process_data(self, previous_result):
        print(f"Processing data for {self.state.user_name}")

        # Modify state (with type checking)
        self.state.items.append("item1")
        self.state.items.append("item2")
        self.state.processed = True
        self.state.completion_percentage = 50.0

        return "Processed"

    @listen(process_data)
    def generate_summary(self, previous_result):
        # Access state (with autocompletion)
        summary = f"User {self.state.user_name} has {len(self.state.items)} items "
        summary += f"with {self.state.preferences.theme} theme. "
        summary += "Data is processed." if self.state.processed else "Data is not processed."
        summary += f" Completion: {self.state.completion_percentage}%"

        return summary

# Run the flow
flow = StructuredStateFlow()
result = flow.kickoff()
print(f"Final result: {result}")
print(f"Final state: {flow.state}")
```

### Benefits of Structured State

Using structured state provides several advantages:

1. **Type Safety** - Catch type errors at development time
2. **Self-Documentation** - The state model clearly documents what data is available
3. **Validation** - Automatic validation of data types and constraints
4. **IDE Support** - Get autocomplete and inline documentation
5. **Default Values** - Easily define fallbacks for missing data

### When to Use Structured State

Structured state is recommended for:

* Complex flows with well-defined data schemas
* Team projects where multiple developers work on the same code
* Applications where data validation is important
* Flows that need to enforce specific data types and constraints

## The Automatic State ID

Both unstructured and structured states automatically receive a unique identifier (UUID) to help track and manage state instances.

### How It Works

* For unstructured state, the ID is accessible as `self.state["id"]`
* For structured state, the ID is accessible as `self.state.id`
* This ID is generated automatically when the flow is created
* The ID remains the same throughout the flow's lifecycle
* The ID can be used for tracking, logging, and retrieving persisted states

This UUID is particularly valuable when implementing persistence or tracking multiple flow executions.

## Dynamic State Updates

Regardless of whether you're using structured or unstructured state, you can update state dynamically throughout your flow's execution.

### Passing Data Between Steps

Flow methods can return values that are then passed as arguments to listening methods:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class DataPassingFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def generate_data(self):
        # This return value will be passed to listening methods
        return "Generated data"

    @listen(generate_data)
    def process_data(self, data_from_previous_step):
        print(f"Received: {data_from_previous_step}")
        # You can modify the data and pass it along
        processed_data = f"{data_from_previous_step} - processed"
        # Also update state
        self.state["last_processed"] = processed_data
        return processed_data

    @listen(process_data)
    def finalize_data(self, processed_data):
        print(f"Received processed data: {processed_data}")
        # Access both the passed data and state
        last_processed = self.state.get("last_processed", "")
        return f"Final: {processed_data} (from state: {last_processed})"
```

This pattern allows you to combine direct data passing with state updates for maximum flexibility.

## Persisting Flow State

One of CrewAI's most powerful features is the ability to persist flow state across executions. This enables workflows that can be paused, resumed, and even recovered after failures.

### The @persist() Decorator

The `@persist()` decorator automates state persistence, saving your flow's state at key points in execution.

#### Class-Level Persistence

When applied at the class level, `@persist()` saves state after every method execution:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from crewai.flow.persistence import persist
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CounterState(BaseModel):
    value: int = 0

@persist()  # Apply to the entire flow class
class PersistentCounterFlow(Flow[CounterState]):
    @start()
    def increment(self):
        self.state.value += 1
        print(f"Incremented to {self.state.value}")
        return self.state.value

    @listen(increment)
    def double(self, value):
        self.state.value = value * 2
        print(f"Doubled to {self.state.value}")
        return self.state.value

# First run
flow1 = PersistentCounterFlow()
result1 = flow1.kickoff()
print(f"First run result: {result1}")

# Second run - state is automatically loaded
flow2 = PersistentCounterFlow()
result2 = flow2.kickoff()
print(f"Second run result: {result2}")  # Will be higher due to persisted state
```

#### Method-Level Persistence

For more granular control, you can apply `@persist()` to specific methods:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from crewai.flow.persistence import persist

class SelectivePersistFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def first_step(self):
        self.state["count"] = 1
        return "First step"

    @persist()  # Only persist after this method
    @listen(first_step)
    def important_step(self, prev_result):
        self.state["count"] += 1
        self.state["important_data"] = "This will be persisted"
        return "Important step completed"

    @listen(important_step)
    def final_step(self, prev_result):
        self.state["count"] += 1
        return f"Complete with count {self.state['count']}"
```

## Advanced State Patterns

### Conditional starts and resumable execution

Flows support conditional `@start()` and resumable execution for HITL/cyclic scenarios:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, start, listen, and_, or_

class ResumableFlow(Flow):
    @start()  # unconditional start
    def init(self):
        ...

    # Conditional start: run after "init" or external trigger name
    @start("init")
    def maybe_begin(self):
        ...

    @listen(and_(init, maybe_begin))
    def proceed(self):
        ...
```

* Conditional `@start()` accepts a method name, a router label, or a callable condition.
* During resume, listeners continue from prior checkpoints; cycle/router branches honor resumption flags.

### State-Based Conditional Logic

You can use state to implement complex conditional logic in your flows:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class PaymentState(BaseModel):
    amount: float = 0.0
    is_approved: bool = False
    retry_count: int = 0

class PaymentFlow(Flow[PaymentState]):
    @start()
    def process_payment(self):
        # Simulate payment processing
        self.state.amount = 100.0
        self.state.is_approved = self.state.amount < 1000
        return "Payment processed"

    @router(process_payment)
    def check_approval(self, previous_result):
        if self.state.is_approved:
            return "approved"
        elif self.state.retry_count < 3:
            return "retry"
        else:
            return "rejected"

    @listen("approved")
    def handle_approval(self):
        return f"Payment of ${self.state.amount} approved!"

    @listen("retry")
    def handle_retry(self):
        self.state.retry_count += 1
        print(f"Retrying payment (attempt {self.state.retry_count})...")
        # Could implement retry logic here
        return "Retry initiated"

    @listen("rejected")
    def handle_rejection(self):
        return f"Payment of ${self.state.amount} rejected after {self.state.retry_count} retries."
```

### Handling Complex State Transformations

For complex state transformations, you can create dedicated methods:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict

class UserData(BaseModel):
    name: str
    active: bool = True
    login_count: int = 0

class ComplexState(BaseModel):
    users: Dict[str, UserData] = {}
    active_user_count: int = 0

class TransformationFlow(Flow[ComplexState]):
    @start()
    def initialize(self):
        # Add some users
        self.add_user("alice", "Alice")
        self.add_user("bob", "Bob")
        self.add_user("charlie", "Charlie")
        return "Initialized"

    @listen(initialize)
    def process_users(self, _):
        # Increment login counts
        for user_id in self.state.users:
            self.increment_login(user_id)

        # Deactivate one user
        self.deactivate_user("bob")

        # Update active count
        self.update_active_count()

        return f"Processed {len(self.state.users)} users"

    # Helper methods for state transformations
    def add_user(self, user_id: str, name: str):
        self.state.users[user_id] = UserData(name=name)
        self.update_active_count()

    def increment_login(self, user_id: str):
        if user_id in self.state.users:
            self.state.users[user_id].login_count += 1

    def deactivate_user(self, user_id: str):
        if user_id in self.state.users:
            self.state.users[user_id].active = False
            self.update_active_count()

    def update_active_count(self):
        self.state.active_user_count = sum(
            1 for user in self.state.users.values() if user.active
        )
```

This pattern of creating helper methods keeps your flow methods clean while enabling complex state manipulations.

## State Management with Crews

One of the most powerful patterns in CrewAI is combining flow state management with crew execution.

### Passing State to Crews

You can use flow state to parameterize crews:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ResearchState(BaseModel):
    topic: str = ""
    depth: str = "medium"
    results: str = ""

class ResearchFlow(Flow[ResearchState]):
    @start()
    def get_parameters(self):
        # In a real app, this might come from user input
        self.state.topic = "Artificial Intelligence Ethics"
        self.state.depth = "deep"
        return "Parameters set"

    @listen(get_parameters)
    def execute_research(self, _):
        # Create agents
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Research Specialist",
            goal=f"Research {self.state.topic} in {self.state.depth} detail",
            backstory="You are an expert researcher with a talent for finding accurate information."
        )

        writer = Agent(
            role="Content Writer",
            goal="Transform research into clear, engaging content",
            backstory="You excel at communicating complex ideas clearly and concisely."
        )

        # Create tasks
        research_task = Task(
            description=f"Research {self.state.topic} with {self.state.depth} analysis",
            expected_output="Comprehensive research notes in markdown format",
            agent=researcher
        )

        writing_task = Task(
            description=f"Create a summary on {self.state.topic} based on the research",
            expected_output="Well-written article in markdown format",
            agent=writer,
            context=[research_task]
        )

        # Create and run crew
        research_crew = Crew(
            agents=[researcher, writer],
            tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )

        # Run crew and store result in state
        result = research_crew.kickoff()
        self.state.results = result.raw

        return "Research completed"

    @listen(execute_research)
    def summarize_results(self, _):
        # Access the stored results
        result_length = len(self.state.results)
        return f"Research on {self.state.topic} completed with {result_length} characters of results."
```

### Handling Crew Outputs in State

When a crew completes, you can process its output and store it in your flow state:

```python  theme={null}
@listen(execute_crew)
def process_crew_results(self, _):
    # Parse the raw results (assuming JSON output)
    import json
    try:
        results_dict = json.loads(self.state.raw_results)
        self.state.processed_results = {
            "title": results_dict.get("title", ""),
            "main_points": results_dict.get("main_points", []),
            "conclusion": results_dict.get("conclusion", "")
        }
        return "Results processed successfully"
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        self.state.error = "Failed to parse crew results as JSON"
        return "Error processing results"
```

## Best Practices for State Management

### 1. Keep State Focused

Design your state to contain only what's necessary:

```python  theme={null}
# Too broad
class BloatedState(BaseModel):
    user_data: Dict = {}
    system_settings: Dict = {}
    temporary_calculations: List = []
    debug_info: Dict = {}
    # ...many more fields

# Better: Focused state
class FocusedState(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    preferences: Dict[str, str]
    completion_status: Dict[str, bool]
```

### 2. Use Structured State for Complex Flows

As your flows grow in complexity, structured state becomes increasingly valuable:

```python  theme={null}
# Simple flow can use unstructured state
class SimpleGreetingFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def greet(self):
        self.state["name"] = "World"
        return f"Hello, {self.state['name']}!"

# Complex flow benefits from structured state
class UserRegistrationState(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str
    verification_status: bool = False
    registration_date: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    last_login: Optional[datetime] = None

class RegistrationFlow(Flow[UserRegistrationState]):
    # Methods with strongly-typed state access
```

### 3. Document State Transitions

For complex flows, document how state changes throughout the execution:

```python  theme={null}
@start()
def initialize_order(self):
    """
    Initialize order state with empty values.

    State before: {}
    State after: {order_id: str, items: [], status: 'new'}
    """
    self.state.order_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    self.state.items = []
    self.state.status = "new"
    return "Order initialized"
```

### 4. Handle State Errors Gracefully

Implement error handling for state access:

```python  theme={null}
@listen(previous_step)
def process_data(self, _):
    try:
        # Try to access a value that might not exist
        user_preference = self.state.preferences.get("theme", "default")
    except (AttributeError, KeyError):
        # Handle the error gracefully
        self.state.errors = self.state.get("errors", [])
        self.state.errors.append("Failed to access preferences")
        user_preference = "default"

    return f"Used preference: {user_preference}"
```

### 5. Use State for Progress Tracking

Leverage state to track progress in long-running flows:

```python  theme={null}
class ProgressTrackingFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def initialize(self):
        self.state["total_steps"] = 3
        self.state["current_step"] = 0
        self.state["progress"] = 0.0
        self.update_progress()
        return "Initialized"

    def update_progress(self):
        """Helper method to calculate and update progress"""
        if self.state.get("total_steps", 0) > 0:
            self.state["progress"] = (self.state.get("current_step", 0) /
                                    self.state["total_steps"]) * 100
            print(f"Progress: {self.state['progress']:.1f}%")

    @listen(initialize)
    def step_one(self, _):
        # Do work...
        self.state["current_step"] = 1
        self.update_progress()
        return "Step 1 complete"

    # Additional steps...
```

### 6. Use Immutable Operations When Possible

Especially with structured state, prefer immutable operations for clarity:

```python  theme={null}
# Instead of modifying lists in place:
self.state.items.append(new_item)  # Mutable operation

# Consider creating new state:
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class ItemState(BaseModel):
    items: List[str] = []

class ImmutableFlow(Flow[ItemState]):
    @start()
    def add_item(self):
        # Create new list with the added item
        self.state.items = [*self.state.items, "new item"]
        return "Item added"
```

## Debugging Flow State

### Logging State Changes

When developing, add logging to track state changes:

```python  theme={null}
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class LoggingFlow(Flow):
    def log_state(self, step_name):
        logging.info(f"State after {step_name}: {self.state}")

    @start()
    def initialize(self):
        self.state["counter"] = 0
        self.log_state("initialize")
        return "Initialized"

    @listen(initialize)
    def increment(self, _):
        self.state["counter"] += 1
        self.log_state("increment")
        return f"Incremented to {self.state['counter']}"
```

### State Visualization

You can add methods to visualize your state for debugging:

```python  theme={null}
def visualize_state(self):
    """Create a simple visualization of the current state"""
    import json
    from rich.console import Console
    from rich.panel import Panel

    console = Console()

    if hasattr(self.state, "model_dump"):
        # Pydantic v2
        state_dict = self.state.model_dump()
    elif hasattr(self.state, "dict"):
        # Pydantic v1
        state_dict = self.state.dict()
    else:
        # Unstructured state
        state_dict = dict(self.state)

    # Remove id for cleaner output
    if "id" in state_dict:
        state_dict.pop("id")

    state_json = json.dumps(state_dict, indent=2, default=str)
    console.print(Panel(state_json, title="Current Flow State"))
```

# Publish Custom Tools

> How to build, package, and publish your own CrewAI-compatible tools to PyPI so any CrewAI user can install and use them.

## Overview

CrewAI's tool system is designed to be extended. If you've built a tool that could benefit others, you can package it as a standalone Python library, publish it to PyPI, and make it available to any CrewAI user — no PR to the CrewAI repo required.

This guide walks through the full process: implementing the tools contract, structuring your package, and publishing to PyPI.

<Note type="info" title="Not looking to publish?">
  If you just need a custom tool for your own project, see the [Create Custom Tools](/en/learn/create-custom-tools) guide instead.
</Note>

## The Tools Contract

Every CrewAI tool must satisfy one of two interfaces:

### Option 1: Subclass `BaseTool`

Subclass `crewai.tools.BaseTool` and implement the `_run` method. Define `name`, `description`, and optionally an `args_schema` for input validation.

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class GeolocateInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for GeolocateTool."""
    address: str = Field(..., description="The street address to geolocate.")


class GeolocateTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Geolocate"
    description: str = "Converts a street address into latitude/longitude coordinates."
    args_schema: type[BaseModel] = GeolocateInput

    def _run(self, address: str) -> str:
        # Your implementation here
        return f"40.7128, -74.0060"
```

### Option 2: Use the `@tool` Decorator

For simpler tools, the `@tool` decorator turns a function into a CrewAI tool. The function **must** have a docstring (used as the tool description) and type annotations.

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.tools import tool


@tool("Geolocate")
def geolocate(address: str) -> str:
    """Converts a street address into latitude/longitude coordinates."""
    return "40.7128, -74.0060"
```

### Key Requirements

Regardless of which approach you use, your tool must:

* Have a **`name`** — a short, descriptive identifier.
* Have a **`description`** — tells the agent when and how to use the tool. This directly affects how well agents use your tool, so be clear and specific.
* Implement **`_run`** (BaseTool) or provide a **function body** (@tool) — the synchronous execution logic.
* Use **type annotations** on all parameters and return values.
* Return a **string** result (or something that can be meaningfully converted to one).

### Optional: Async Support

If your tool performs I/O-bound work, implement `_arun` for async execution:

```python  theme={null}
class GeolocateTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Geolocate"
    description: str = "Converts a street address into latitude/longitude coordinates."

    def _run(self, address: str) -> str:
        # Sync implementation
        ...

    async def _arun(self, address: str) -> str:
        # Async implementation
        ...
```

### Optional: Input Validation with `args_schema`

Define a Pydantic model as your `args_schema` to get automatic input validation and clear error messages. If you don't provide one, CrewAI will infer it from your `_run` method's signature.

```python  theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class TranslateInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for TranslateTool."""
    text: str = Field(..., description="The text to translate.")
    target_language: str = Field(
        default="en",
        description="ISO 639-1 language code for the target language.",
    )
```

Explicit schemas are recommended for published tools — they produce better agent behavior and clearer documentation for your users.

### Optional: Environment Variables

If your tool requires API keys or other configuration, declare them with `env_vars` so users know what to set:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai.tools import BaseTool, EnvVar


class GeolocateTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Geolocate"
    description: str = "Converts a street address into latitude/longitude coordinates."
    env_vars: list[EnvVar] = [
        EnvVar(
            name="GEOCODING_API_KEY",
            description="API key for the geocoding service.",
            required=True,
        ),
    ]

    def _run(self, address: str) -> str:
        ...
```

## Package Structure

Structure your project as a standard Python package. Here's a recommended layout:

```
crewai-geolocate/
├── pyproject.toml
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── src/
    └── crewai_geolocate/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── tools.py
```

### `pyproject.toml`

```toml  theme={null}
[project]
name = "crewai-geolocate"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A CrewAI tool for geolocating street addresses."
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "crewai",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

Declare `crewai` as a dependency so users get a compatible version automatically.

### `__init__.py`

Re-export your tool classes so users can import them directly:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai_geolocate.tools import GeolocateTool

__all__ = ["GeolocateTool"]
```

### Naming Conventions

* **Package name**: Use the prefix `crewai-` (e.g., `crewai-geolocate`). This makes your tool discoverable when users search PyPI.
* **Module name**: Use underscores (e.g., `crewai_geolocate`).
* **Tool class name**: Use PascalCase ending in `Tool` (e.g., `GeolocateTool`).

## Testing Your Tool

Before publishing, verify your tool works within a crew:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai_geolocate import GeolocateTool

agent = Agent(
    role="Location Analyst",
    goal="Find coordinates for given addresses.",
    backstory="An expert in geospatial data.",
    tools=[GeolocateTool()],
)

task = Task(
    description="Find the coordinates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.",
    expected_output="The latitude and longitude of the address.",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

## Publishing to PyPI

Once your tool is tested and ready:

```bash  theme={null}
# Build the package
uv build

# Publish to PyPI
uv publish
```

If this is your first time publishing, you'll need a [PyPI account](https://pypi.org/account/register/) and an [API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).

### After Publishing

Users can install your tool with:

```bash  theme={null}
pip install crewai-geolocate
```

Or with uv:

```bash  theme={null}
uv add crewai-geolocate
```

Then use it in their crews:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai_geolocate import GeolocateTool

agent = Agent(
    role="Location Analyst",
    tools=[GeolocateTool()],
    # ...
)
```

# Coding Tools

> Use AGENTS.md to guide coding agents and IDEs across your CrewAI projects.

## Why AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is a lightweight, repo-local instruction file that gives coding agents consistent, project-specific guidance. Keep it in the project root and treat it as the source of truth for how you want assistants to work: conventions, commands, architecture notes, and guardrails.

## Create a Project with the CLI

Use the CrewAI CLI to scaffold a project, then `AGENTS.md` will be automatically added at the root.

```bash  theme={null}
# Crew
crewai create crew my_crew

# Flow
crewai create flow my_flow

# Tool repository
crewai tool create my_tool
```

## Tool Setup: Point Assistants to AGENTS.md

### Codex

Codex can be guided by `AGENTS.md` files placed in your repository. Use them to supply persistent project context such as conventions, commands, and workflow expectations.

### Claude Code

Claude Code stores project memory in `CLAUDE.md`. You can bootstrap it with `/init` and edit it using `/memory`. Claude Code also supports imports inside `CLAUDE.md`, so you can add a single line like `@AGENTS.md` to pull in the shared instructions without duplicating them.

You can simply use:

```bash  theme={null}
mv AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

### Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity

Gemini CLI and Antigravity load a project context file (default: `GEMINI.md`) from the repo root and parent directories. You can configure it to read `AGENTS.md` instead (or in addition) by setting `context.fileName` in your Gemini CLI settings. For example, set it to `AGENTS.md` only, or include both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` if you want to keep each tool’s format.

You can simply use:

```bash  theme={null}
mv AGENTS.md GEMINI.md
```

### Cursor

Cursor supports `AGENTS.md` as a project instruction file. Place it at the project root to provide guidance for Cursor’s coding assistant.

### Windsurf

Claude Code provides an official integration with Windsurf. If you use Claude Code inside Windsurf, follow the Claude Code guidance above and import `AGENTS.md` from `CLAUDE.md`.

If you are using Windsurf’s native assistant, configure its project rules or instructions feature (if available) to read from `AGENTS.md` or paste the contents directly.

# Customizing Prompts

> Dive deeper into low-level prompt customization for CrewAI, enabling super custom and complex use cases for different models and languages.

## Why Customize Prompts?

Although CrewAI's default prompts work well for many scenarios, low-level customization opens the door to significantly more flexible and powerful agent behavior. Here's why you might want to take advantage of this deeper control:

1. **Optimize for specific LLMs** – Different models (such as GPT-4, Claude, or Llama) thrive with prompt formats tailored to their unique architectures.
2. **Change the language** – Build agents that operate exclusively in languages beyond English, handling nuances with precision.
3. **Specialize for complex domains** – Adapt prompts for highly specialized industries like healthcare, finance, or legal.
4. **Adjust tone and style** – Make agents more formal, casual, creative, or analytical.
5. **Support super custom use cases** – Utilize advanced prompt structures and formatting to meet intricate, project-specific requirements.

This guide explores how to tap into CrewAI's prompts at a lower level, giving you fine-grained control over how agents think and interact.

## Understanding CrewAI's Prompt System

Under the hood, CrewAI employs a modular prompt system that you can customize extensively:

* **Agent templates** – Govern each agent's approach to their assigned role.
* **Prompt slices** – Control specialized behaviors such as tasks, tool usage, and output structure.
* **Error handling** – Direct how agents respond to failures, exceptions, or timeouts.
* **Tool-specific prompts** – Define detailed instructions for how tools are invoked or utilized.

Check out the [original prompt templates in CrewAI's repository](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/src/crewai/translations/en.json) to see how these elements are organized. From there, you can override or adapt them as needed to unlock advanced behaviors.

## Understanding Default System Instructions

<Warning>
  **Production Transparency Issue**: CrewAI automatically injects default instructions into your prompts that you might not be aware of. This section explains what's happening under the hood and how to gain full control.
</Warning>

When you define an agent with `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`, CrewAI automatically adds additional system instructions that control formatting and behavior. Understanding these default injections is crucial for production systems where you need full prompt transparency.

### What CrewAI Automatically Injects

Based on your agent configuration, CrewAI adds different default instructions:

#### For Agents Without Tools

```text  theme={null}
"I MUST use these formats, my job depends on it!"
```

#### For Agents With Tools

```text  theme={null}
"IMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [tool_names]
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object...
```

#### For Structured Outputs (JSON/Pydantic)

````text  theme={null}
"Ensure your final answer contains only the content in the following format: {output_format}
Ensure the final output does not include any code block markers like ```json or ```python."
````

### Viewing the Complete System Prompt

To see exactly what prompt is being sent to your LLM, you can inspect the generated prompt:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.utilities.prompts import Prompts

# Create your agent
agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights",
    backstory="You are an expert data analyst with 10 years of experience.",
    verbose=True
)

# Create a sample task
task = Task(
    description="Analyze the sales data and identify trends",
    expected_output="A detailed analysis with key insights and trends",
    agent=agent
)

# Create the prompt generator
prompt_generator = Prompts(
    agent=agent,
    has_tools=len(agent.tools) > 0,
    use_system_prompt=agent.use_system_prompt
)

# Generate and inspect the actual prompt
generated_prompt = prompt_generator.task_execution()

# Print the complete system prompt that will be sent to the LLM
if "system" in generated_prompt:
    print("=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===")
    print(generated_prompt["system"])
    print("\n=== USER PROMPT ===")
    print(generated_prompt["user"])
else:
    print("=== COMPLETE PROMPT ===")
    print(generated_prompt["prompt"])

# You can also see how the task description gets formatted
print("\n=== TASK CONTEXT ===")
print(f"Task Description: {task.description}")
print(f"Expected Output: {task.expected_output}")
```

### Overriding Default Instructions

You have several options to gain full control over the prompts:

#### Option 1: Custom Templates (Recommended)

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent

# Define your own system template without default instructions
custom_system_template = """You are {role}. {backstory}
Your goal is: {goal}

Respond naturally and conversationally. Focus on providing helpful, accurate information."""

custom_prompt_template = """Task: {input}

Please complete this task thoughtfully."""

agent = Agent(
    role="Research Assistant",
    goal="Help users find accurate information",
    backstory="You are a helpful research assistant.",
    system_template=custom_system_template,
    prompt_template=custom_prompt_template,
    use_system_prompt=True  # Use separate system/user messages
)
```

#### Option 2: Custom Prompt File

Create a `custom_prompts.json` file to override specific prompt slices:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "slices": {
    "no_tools": "\nProvide your best answer in a natural, conversational way.",
    "tools": "\nYou have access to these tools: {tools}\n\nUse them when helpful, but respond naturally.",
    "formatted_task_instructions": "Format your response as: {output_format}"
  }
}
```

Then use it in your crew:

```python  theme={null}
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    prompt_file="custom_prompts.json",
    verbose=True
)
```

#### Option 3: Disable System Prompts for o1 Models

```python  theme={null}
agent = Agent(
    role="Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data",
    backstory="Expert analyst",
    use_system_prompt=False  # Disables system prompt separation
)
```

### Debugging with Observability Tools

For production transparency, integrate with observability platforms to monitor all prompts and LLM interactions. This allows you to see exactly what prompts (including default instructions) are being sent to your LLMs.

See our [Observability documentation](/en/observability/overview) for detailed integration guides with various platforms including Langfuse, MLflow, Weights & Biases, and custom logging solutions.

### Best Practices for Production

1. **Always inspect generated prompts** before deploying to production
2. **Use custom templates** when you need full control over prompt content
3. **Integrate observability tools** for ongoing prompt monitoring (see [Observability docs](/en/observability/overview))
4. **Test with different LLMs** as default instructions may work differently across models
5. **Document your prompt customizations** for team transparency

## Best Practices for Managing Prompt Files

When engaging in low-level prompt customization, follow these guidelines to keep things organized and maintainable:

1. **Keep files separate** – Store your customized prompts in dedicated JSON files outside your main codebase.
2. **Version control** – Track changes within your repository, ensuring clear documentation of prompt adjustments over time.
3. **Organize by model or language** – Use naming schemes like `prompts_llama.json` or `prompts_es.json` to quickly identify specialized configurations.
4. **Document changes** – Provide comments or maintain a README detailing the purpose and scope of your customizations.
5. **Minimize alterations** – Only override the specific slices you genuinely need to adjust, keeping default functionality intact for everything else.

## The Simplest Way to Customize Prompts

One straightforward approach is to create a JSON file for the prompts you want to override and then point your Crew at that file:

1. Craft a JSON file with your updated prompt slices.
2. Reference that file via the `prompt_file` parameter in your Crew.

CrewAI then merges your customizations with the defaults, so you don't have to redefine every prompt. Here's how:

### Example: Basic Prompt Customization

Create a `custom_prompts.json` file with the prompts you want to modify. Ensure you list all top-level prompts it should contain, not just your changes:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "slices": {
    "format": "When responding, follow this structure:\n\nTHOUGHTS: Your step-by-step thinking\nACTION: Any tool you're using\nRESULT: Your final answer or conclusion"
  }
}
```

Then integrate it like so:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process

# Create agents and tasks as normal
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find information on quantum computing",
    backstory="You are a quantum physics expert",
    verbose=True
)

research_task = Task(
    description="Research quantum computing applications",
    expected_output="A summary of practical applications",
    agent=researcher
)

# Create a crew with your custom prompt file
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    prompt_file="path/to/custom_prompts.json",
    verbose=True
)

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
```

With these few edits, you gain low-level control over how your agents communicate and solve tasks.

## Optimizing for Specific Models

Different models thrive on differently structured prompts. Making deeper adjustments can significantly boost performance by aligning your prompts with a model's nuances.

### Example: Llama 3.3 Prompting Template

For instance, when dealing with Meta's Llama 3.3, deeper-level customization may reflect the recommended structure described at:
[https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3\_1/#prompt-template](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_1/#prompt-template)

Here's an example to highlight how you might fine-tune an Agent to leverage Llama 3.3 in code:

```python  theme={null}
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process
from crewai_tools import DirectoryReadTool, FileReadTool

# Define templates for system, user (prompt), and assistant (response) messages
system_template = """<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>{{ .System }}<|eot_id|>"""
prompt_template = """<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>"""
response_template = """<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>"""

# Create an Agent using Llama-specific layouts
principal_engineer = Agent(
    role="Principal Engineer",
    goal="Oversee AI architecture and make high-level decisions",
    backstory="You are the lead engineer responsible for critical AI systems",
    verbose=True,
    llm="groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile",  # Using the Llama 3 model
    system_template=system_template,
    prompt_template=prompt_template,
    response_template=response_template,
    tools=[DirectoryReadTool(), FileReadTool()]
)

# Define a sample task
engineering_task = Task(
    description="Review AI implementation files for potential improvements",
    expected_output="A summary of key findings and recommendations",
    agent=principal_engineer
)

# Create a Crew for the task
llama_crew = Crew(
    agents=[principal_engineer],
    tasks=[engineering_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the crew
result = llama_crew.kickoff()
print(result.raw)
```

Through this deeper configuration, you can exercise comprehensive, low-level control over your Llama-based workflows without needing a separate JSON file.

## Conclusion

Low-level prompt customization in CrewAI opens the door to super custom, complex use cases. By establishing well-organized prompt files (or direct inline templates), you can accommodate various models, languages, and specialized domains. This level of flexibility ensures you can craft precisely the AI behavior you need, all while knowing CrewAI still provides reliable defaults when you don't override them.
